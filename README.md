# State-Estimation

## Description
This is a state-estimation project I'm working on based on the Eigen math library. 
The goal is to develop a set of state-estimation tools for both linear and non-linear systems.
Eventually, the goal is to eventually incorporate a user-interface for visualization purposes.

## Dependencies
This currently only requires [Eigen](https://github.com/libigl/eigen).
